# About the Project
This is a python package built to analyze suspension kinematics. It is designed to be modular to allow the user to confiugure almost any possible suspension geometry (five link, double A arm, Macpherson Strut, etc.).

# Project Status
<ins>Recent Progress</ins>

A basic 5 link suspension solver has been written.


<ins>Todo List</ins>
- [x] Rewrite current demo program as a jupyter notebook
- [x] Add 3d animations with vpython
- [ ] Fix indexing in kinematic_model class so that it can work with various types of links
- [ ] Refactor matrix generation to reduce copying of arrays
- [ ] Create auxiliary pickups for push rods, sway bars, and coilovers
- [ ] Figure out why the jacobian test is failing
- [ ] Add ability to import and save as csv file
- [ ] Write methods for different suspension componenets
- [ ] Create suspension geometry optimization algoritms
